You would need to populate them with 9 more questions each, focusing on the specific topics and difficulty levels as outlined in the description. Ensure the questions cover a range of concepts from the provided content, such as HDFS architecture, MapReduce programming model, YARN components, and Hadoop ecosystem tools. Remember to provide the correct answer and explanation for each question."
