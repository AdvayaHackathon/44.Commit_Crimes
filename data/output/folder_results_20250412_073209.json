Data usage has shifted from megabytes to petabytes for processing, analysis, and knowledge discovery.\n* Traditional systems struggle with the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data, along with its complex formats and the need for rapid processing and analysis.\n\n*(Figure depicting data usage and growth, showing the increasing proportion of unstructured data with increasing size and complexity -  Unable to reproduce image.  See original document.)*\n\n**Data**\n\n* Data has various definitions and can be singular or plural.  Some definitions include:\n    * Information (facts or statistics) for analysis or calculations.\n    * Information stored and used by computer programs.\n    * Information presented in numbers, letters, or other forms.\n    * Information from observations, measurements, or facts (including behavioral ones).\n\n**Web Data**\n\n* Data residing on web or enterprise servers in various formats (text, images, video, audio, multimedia).\n* Users interact with this data through client software.\n* Data access can be pull-based (client requests data) or push-based (server sends data).\n* Sources include websites, web services, portals, online applications, emails, social media, etc.\n\n**Classification of Data**\n\n* **Structured Data:**\n    * Conforms to schemas and data models (e.g., tables with rows and columns).\n    * Enables data manipulation (insert, delete, update, append), indexing for faster retrieval, scalability, and security (encryption/decryption).\n    * Represents roughly 15-20% of existing data.\n* **Semi-Structured Data:**\n    * Contains tags or markers to separate semantic elements and create hierarchies (e.g., XML, JSON).\n    * Doesn't conform to formal data models.\n* **Multi-Structured Data:**\n    * Consists of a mix of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data formats.\n    * Often found in non-transactional systems (e.g., streaming data, sensor data, data warehouses).\n    * May have some semantic meaning.\n* **Unstructured Data:**\n    * Lacks predefined structure (e.g., text files, CSV files, emails).\n    * Relationships, schemas, and features need to be defined.\n\n**Big Data**\n\n* Several definitions exist, emphasizing:\n    * High volume, velocity, and variety requiring new processing methods for enhanced decision-making and insight discovery.\n    * Datasets too large or complex for traditional data processing applications.\n    * Datasets whose size presents significant logistical challenges for manipulation and management.\n    * Datasets exceeding the capacity of typical database software for capture, storage, management, and analysis.\n\n\n**Big Data Characteristics (The 4 Vs + Veracity)**\n\n* **Volume:** The quantity of data generated.\n* **Velocity:** The speed of data generation and processing.\n* **Variety:**  The different forms and formats of data from various sources.\n* **Veracity:** The quality and accuracy of the captured data.\n\n**Big Data Types**\n\n1. Social media and web data.\n2. Transaction and business process data (e.g., credit card transactions, flight bookings, medical records).\n3. Customer master data (e.g., demographics, biometrics).\n4. Machine-generated data (e.g., sensor data, logs).\n5. Human-generated data (e.g., biometrics, email records).\n\n**(Table of Big Data Classification - Unable to reproduce table cleanly due to image quality.

Please see the original document.)*\n\n\n**Scalability and Parallel Processing**\n\n* Big Data processing requires intensive computations and often hundreds of computing nodes.\n* **Convergence of Data Environments and Analytics:** Requires scaling up (vertical scaling - increasing resources of a single system) and scaling out (horizontal scaling - adding more systems).\n* **Analytics Scalability:**  Vertical scaling improves the capacity of a single system. Horizontal scaling distributes the workload across multiple systems.\n\n**Massively Parallel Processing Platforms**\n\n* Utilizes multiple computers or CPUs to enhance performance.\n* Parallelization can occur at the thread, CPU, or computer level.\n\n**Distributed Computing Model**\n\n* Uses cloud, grid, or cluster computing to process large datasets on distributed nodes connected via high-speed networks.\n* Suitable for various dataset sizes.\n* Utilizes parallel, scalable, and no-sharing program models like MapReduce.\n\n**Cloud Computing**\n\n* Internet-based computing providing shared processing resources and data on demand.\n* Suitable for parallel and distributed computing.\n* **Types of Cloud Services:**\n    * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**  Provides access to hardware resources (e.g., storage, servers).\n    * **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a runtime environment for developing and deploying applications.\n    * **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet.\n\n**Grid and Cluster Computing**\n\n* **Grid Computing:** Connects geographically dispersed computers to achieve a common task.  Suitable for large-scale resource sharing and data-intensive storage.  Single point of failure can be a drawback.\n* **Cluster Computing:** Connects a group of computers via a network to work together, primarily used for load balancing.\n* **Volunteer Computing:**  Utilizes computing resources provided by volunteers for distributed computing and storage.\n\n\n**Designing Data Architecture**\n\n* Big Data architecture defines how data is stored, accessed, and managed.\n* **Logical Layers Approach:** Simplifies design by dividing the architecture into five layers:\n    1. Identification of data sources.\n    2. Data ingestion and acquisition.\n    3. Data storage.\n    4. Data processing.\n    5. Data consumption.\n\n*(Diagram illustrating the five layers of Big Data architecture and their functions -  Unable to reproduce image. Please refer to the original document.)*\n\n\n**Quality, Pre-processing**\n\n* **Data Quality:** High-quality data ensures accurate operations, analysis, and decision-making.  Five R's of data quality: Relevancy, Recency, Range, Robustness, and Reliability.\n* **Data Integrity:** Maintaining consistency and accuracy of data over its lifecycle.\n* **Data Noise:** Meaningless information within the data, affecting analysis accuracy.\n* **Outliers:** Data points outside the expected range, often caused by errors or anomalies.\n* **Missing Values:** Gaps in the dataset.\n* **Duplicate Values:**  Redundant data entries.\n* **Data Pre-processing:** Essential for data mining and analytics. Involves:\n    * Handling missing values, outliers, etc.\n    * Filtering unreliable or irrelevant data.\n    * Data cleaning, editing, reduction, and wrangling.\n    * Data validation, transformation, and transcoding.\n    * Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) processing.\n\n**Big Data Platform**\n\n* Supports large, high-velocity, and varied datasets.\n* Provides tools and services for storage, processing, analytics, environment management, application integration, and traditional/Big Data techniques.\n\n*(Diagram of a Hadoop-based Big Data environment)*\n\n**Big Data Analytics Applications and Case Studies**\n\n* **Marketing and Sales:**  Big Data provides insights into customer behavior, campaign effectiveness, and market trends.  Used for customer value analytics (CVA), fraud detection, and hyper-localized advertising.\n* **Credit Risk Management:** Helps financial institutions assess and manage loan risks.\n* **Healthcare:** Improves patient care, reduces costs, and facilitates research.\n* **Medicine:**  Facilitates research and development of new treatments.\n* **Advertising:** Enables targeted and personalized advertising campaigns.\n\n**Big Data Risks**\n\n* Potential for erroneous or inaccurate data leading to flawed analysis.\n* Requires robust risk management procedures.\n\n\nNote: The output has been organized and formatted for improved readability.
